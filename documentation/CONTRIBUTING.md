Welcome and thank you for expressing interest in contributing. If you're unsure or afraid of anything, feel free to ask for help. You can submit a work in progress (WIP) pull request, or file an issue with the parts you know. We'll do our best to guide you in the right direction, and let you know if there are guidelines you will need to follow. We want people to be able to participate without fear of doing the wrong thing.

Below are our expectations for contributors. Following these guidelines gives us the best opportunity to work with you, by making sure we have the things we need in order to make it happen.

1. Open an issue. This allows for discussion to occure before starting any work that potentially might be rejected.

2. Ensure you write test cases for your contributions.
